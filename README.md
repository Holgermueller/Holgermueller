### Hi there, I'm Holger ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer, specializing in front-end development and UX/UI design living in Batesville, Arkansas, but I'm originally from the Hudson Valley in New York. I've also lived in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, MN where I endured the beligerent Minnesota winters for several years. I enjoy reading, watching movies, writing, listening to music, exercising, spending time with my wife, and drawing.
