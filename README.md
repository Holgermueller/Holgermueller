### Hi there, I'm Holger ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer living in Batesville, Arkansas, but I'm originally from the Hudson Valley in NY. I've also spent several years in Minneapolis, MN where I endured the beligerent Minnesota winters. I enjoy reading, watching movies, writing, listening to music, exercising, spending time with my wife, and drawing.
